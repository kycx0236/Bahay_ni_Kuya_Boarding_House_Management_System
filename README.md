Project Description: An application intended as a new and efficient way of managing boarding houses through the use of technology. The system is designed to automate the operations of managing a boarding house, which can record and store tenants and owners information, handle computations regarding the monthly bills and payments of tenants, monitor status of rooms and has a database backup system.  It will assist the owners/managers to improve their operational efficiency of recording and storing information.
